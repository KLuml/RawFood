<h2>What is a raw foods life style about?</h2>

<img src ="Raw-food-heart.jpg" class = "text-wrap">

<p>You are probably wondering what a raw food lifestyle is. You even may be wondering how a lifestyle could revolve around raw foods. The question 
should be, are you ready to start enjoying the benefits raw foods have to offer in every aspect of your life? This Life Style 
requires no specialized skill. It only requires the willingness to learn, apply tips, tricks and guides provided for living a 
more rich and fulfilling life.</p>

<p> This is a life style that anybody can work on. Age, wealth, health, education and any
other distinction is not a restriction. We all know and love certain fruits and vegetables. If we don't
know, we certainly can learn and enjoy the fruits and vegetables if not for their tastes, than their merits.
The health benefits associated with fruits and vegetables are well documented and proven. </p>

<p>The first objective of what we hope to accomplish is to educate the general public. Each and every
individual will know that there is commonly a raw food alternative. Examples include: hygiene, diet, 
supplementation, fitness and most other categories. Once you are aware of these alternatives and have a personal interest
in committing yourself to incorporating this life style, phase 2 begins. </p>

<p>The second objective to accomplishing our main goal is to provide resources.  Bringing awareness and knowledge to the lifestyle is great. Providing resources as tools is great too! I searched through the web to provide videos, articles and book resources. I have selected the most practical and have found them very useful for daily life.</p>
 



<h2>What a raw food life style IS</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Path to nature</li>
	<li>Improvement of health</li>
	<li>Achieving homeostasis</li>
</ul>
<h2> What a raw food life style is NOT</h2>
<ul>

	<li>Strict set of guidelines</li>
	<li>For the elite or rich</li>
	<li>Stressful</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health matters!</h2>

<p>As the old adage goes, "health is wealth." Since the beginning of time, humans have been interested in immortality. Great legends such as The Fountain of Youth
have been told, retold and will continue to be told. Since their is no fountain of youth, we must settle for the next best thing. We do know what our body needs
to achieve homeostasis. We know that being deficient in 1 nutrient can kill a man. What we also know are the most and least nutrient dense foods. We know that raw
foods can provide all the needs to achieve homeostasis.</p>

<p>Priorities are important. What we prioritize and what we don't prioritize are equally important. The majority of people claim to have feelings of being tired,
aggravation, sluggishness, not feeling 100% and some don't even want to get out of the bed. The truth is <strong>we will always be filled with stress.</strong> This is a fact of life,
we are a symphony of coordination between complicated systems we don't fully understand. Our duty is to maintain our bodies as we maintain our cars. We take our
cars in for <strong> scheduled</strong> check ups, oil changes, fluid checks, tire pressure, and a myriad of other maintenance tasks we put into our cars. We
 can easily tell who takes responsibility for their vehicles. It looks, sounds, runs and performs well. Our health is 1000 times more complex and critical.</p>
 
 <p>The longevity of your car is important. What's as equally important is quality of life. If every 3 months you need to replace or fix different parts. It can
 become more costly then the maintenance would have. The added stress from constant check ups, bad news, break downs and time out of service add up.
 Now apply this to your life. We break down periodically with age and thats acceptable. What is not acceptable, is self-destruction.</p>
