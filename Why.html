<h1>Why should I even care?</h1>



<h1>Homeostasis</h1>
<img src ="./imgs/Homeostasis.jpg" alt="Human body balancing with the word Homeostasis in front" class = "text-wrap">

<p>Homeostasis means maintaining a stable balance between interdependent systems. I'll use the body to break this concept down further. We'll talk about some of the different systems and resources needed for a body to run optimally -aka achieving a state of homeostasis.</p>

<p>To achieve homeostasis the body requires a certain amount of resources everyday. Dehydration can cause kidney failure, an organ responsible for filtering blood. Vitamins A,B and D are a few responsible for stomach and gut health. Being deficient in any can lead to gastro intestinal problems. These things don't happen over night. Most of us are happy with our health and current level of fitness. These deficiencies are more apparent in older people. We can generally look at someone and tell if they were health conscience throughout the first 50 years of life. An optimal living experience requires each part receiving proper resources to handle it's individual responsibility.</p>

<p>If we decided not to put the proper resources into those systems. The negative affect it has on the body depends on the system being neglected. Not all of us know exactly what each system does or how it coordinates with the other systems. What we do know is if we neglect our body it will eventually lose it's performance, break down, or worse.</p>


<h1> Why raw foods for homeostasis? </h1>



<h3>Cellular nutrition</h3>

<p>Focusing on supplying every cell of our bodies with the essential building blocks for life! "Eat for fuel not for pleasure", "Food is medicine". These may be quotes you've heard and brushed off </p>

<h3> acid-base balance</h3>

<p>One common example of how specific conditions have to be for the body to function is body tempature. If the body's tempature goes two degrees in either direction we know immediately something is unbalanced. The WHOLE body is trying to maintain this small margin of balance. One factor our food contributes to is how acidic or alkaline our body is. Most foods that aren't raw or organic are processed, sweetened, fried. These and many other methods can cause foods to be highly acidic. Raw foods can be acidic too like lemons,grapes, and blue berries.</p>

<p>Our kidneys and lungs work to maintain the acid-base balance. Slight variations from the balance range can have significant effects on vital organs.</p>

<h3>Cooking food</h3>

<p>Raw foods coming from living resources: plants, fruits, vegetables, are foods we have been eating since the beginning. The body has adapted to absorb the nutrients. Raw foods are living foods filled with proteins, enzymes, minerals, and vitamins. When heat is applied to our food we lose a percentage of benefits. A quote used frequently is "Living foods for a living body"!</p>
