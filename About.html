<p>My journey towards raw foods begins about two years ago. I suffered an injury and required surgery. I was unable to get surgery for a whole year, and in that year I was at 20%. Most of my free time was spent in bed. The day of my injury I was a lean 185 lbs. The day after surgery I was 230 lbs and due to the nature of the surgery I was inactive for weeks and bumped up to 250 lbs.</p>

<p> I was very active before the injury and never had to worry about the foods I consumed. I was usually active at work, and when I was free you could find me at the park playing basketball or touch football. After the surgery I was on crutches and I had to learn about nutrition. After weeks of being bed ridden and browsing the web I learned about raw foods from a friend.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2018 I have started to incorporate raw foods into my diet. In the 3 months of incorporating more raw foods in my diet I have managed to lose 30lbs. I have not increased my exercise, but I did start to eat more raw foods.</p>

<p>My biggest vice are snacks. I could snack on chocolate, sweets, and a wide array of different foods. The first thing I changed was the snacks I would eat. I started with guacamole. I would buy 2-3 avacadoes and make some for those moments I would normally walk into the pantry and eat junk food. Eventually I got tired of the guacamole and started to have other fruits/veggies on hand to eat. Oranges, apples, plums, and grapes are my new go to foods inbetween meals.</p>

<p>My second change came after a few weeks of consistently eating raw foods for snacks. Before some meals I would add a salad at the beginning of the meal. This would fill me up with calorie-light, but nutrient dense foods. Salads could consist of cucumber, onions, peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and each week I would try a new ingredient. I've also been researching home-made salad dressings to add flavor.</p>
